# MEAN Stack Boilerplate with Bootstrap 4

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.2.

## Tech Stack:

- **MongoDB/[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)**: MongoDB is a document-oriented database program. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data and connects to MongoDB. 
- **[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)**: Minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**: Progressive, single-paged web application framework.
- **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)**: Server-side JavaScript that uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. 

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies of this app on your machine. This will take about 5 minutes.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` to run both Angular and Node servers with live reload. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 

NOTE: Angular will run on port `4200`, proxying to the Node server on port `3000`. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build & Production server

Run `npm run start` to compile the Angular source code into a `/dist` folder. The build artifacts will be stored in the `/dist` directory. Your Express app will access that folder.
